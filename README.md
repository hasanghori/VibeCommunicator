# VibeCommunicator

This is a project to send data between two phones using vibrations. For a proof of concept, we built a tic tac toe game
where one phone communicated the position of the X's and O's via vibration and the other phone displayed these taps. [Here is a demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OokrswrIiYPWfbF-Iqu6l-GkEll0stqG/view?resourcekey) 
of the working system.

We built the user interface for the Tic Tac Toe game and the logic for the `playerTap` function in `MainActivity.kt` based off [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-build-a-tic-tac-toe-game-in-android/).
